Positive Aspects:
Thank you for your submission. Your work is well-thought-out and comprehensive.
Your code contains correct indentation, spacing and has been well documented.
You display a good understanding of both java and recursion. This is overall
a great first attempt.


Aspects Of Submission That Could Be Improved:
// Completion:
Your program however does not run as expected, This is due to the following:

-The reverse_string method ( line 18) have defined gives an error as you do
not call the method correctly due to the fact that the declaration of your
method is not in camel case.

-You should try to use names that are more descriptive when initializing/declaring variables and methods.
The name of the second method you declare should indicate that it returns a Fibonacci sequence.

-The second method that you have defined on line 28 does not function as expected as your program overrides
the variable parsed into the function with line 30.
It should take in a variable of type int not T And your function does not return a value.

// Style:
Kindly note that your code does not contain the correct style as you have not used the correct naming conventions.
the class name should be the same name as the file. The First letter of this name should always be capitalized as this
is best practice. (E.g public class Dog.)
