Positive Aspects:

Thank you for your submission, Your Work Is well-thought-out and comprehensive.
You display a good understanding of working with dictionaries and the for loop.
This is a great first attempt.

Aspects That Could Be Improved:

# Completion:
Unfortunately, your program is not functioning as expected. This is due to the following:

- Spacing & Indentation
Your spacing and indentation are incorrect.
The code from line 5 - line 12 should be indented into the method defined on line 2.

- Method On Line 2
Method/Function names should not contain any upper case letters and should always be in
snake_case if they are more than one word as opposed to camelCase.
The method would run into a compilation error.
This is because there is no value parsed into the "sorted()" function
(Once Indentation Is Corrected It Would Be Either Line 5 or 6.)

- Unnecessary Class
Whilst your program does produce the desired output, Creating a class (Line 1),
method (line 2) and object (Line 13) to perform this task can be seen as unnecessary.
You could achieve the same result by making the method (line 2) a function and calling
it on the string array (line 14) without having to create the class and the object.

# Style:
Kindly note that your code is not in line with the PEP 8 Style Guidelines as your
spacing and indentation are incorrect.
Your code should contain variable names that are
more descriptive as this would improve the readability of your code.
There should always be a two-line space after the last line of a function.

You may refer to the link provided below when making your changes.

Documentation:
Kindly note that your code does not contain any comments. Comments are important
as they help you and other developers that may work on your code understand the
software that you have created.


Overall Feedback

This is overall a great submission. Please make the relevant changes, resubmit and I
shall take another look.
