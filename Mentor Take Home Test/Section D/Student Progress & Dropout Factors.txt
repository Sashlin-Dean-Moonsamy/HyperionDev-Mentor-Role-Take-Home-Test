# Question

As a mentor, you are invested in every student’s progress, as well as responsible for ensuring high task completion and graduation rates for our bootcamps.
As most of our students are completely online, mentors and students don’t meet in person.
How would you look out for potential ‘dropout factors’ in a student, and what would you do to ensure they don’t drop out?

# Answer

Due to the fact that most of the students are completely online some dropout factors that I would look for may include the following.

-A lack of consistency in submissions and work ethic.
If a student is not consistent with their submissions or their work ethic, This may be an indication of a lack of understanding/motivation which
may lead to the student falling behind and losing core concepts. This may have a negative effect on the student and lead to them dropping out of the course.

A solution to prevent the student of dropping out due to a situation such as this would be to reach out to the student and have a synchronous call
in which these issues may be addressed and the student can get a solid foundation of concepts they may not understand. The student can also receive
guidance on the importance of a good work ethic and how it may affect him/her In the technical world.

- Difficulty Understanding Course Content, Especially early on in the course.
Some students may find it a challenge to understand the course content. This may be due to reasons such as a lack in prior knowledge, such as solid math foundation,
or due to the student overlooking important topics in the course. A situation such as this could lead to the student falling behind, receiving a lower average and
eventually being demotivated which may lead to the student dropping out.

A solution to prevent the student from dropping out in a circumstance such as the one mentioned above would be to provide the student with additional
resources and learning material that may bridge the gap between the students prior knowledge and the course content. Measures can be taken to reach
out to the student and explain the importance of the content being taught, as well as give the student a good understanding of topics they may not fully
grasp.

- Reliance On Assistance To Complete Tasks.
Some students may become reliant on assistance of others to complete their tasks, This may result in the student repetitively booking synchronous calls with
mentors or reviews to complete their assessments. This may result in the student falling behind and being unable to complete the course leading to the student
dropping out of the course.

A solution to prevent a student from dropping out in a situation such as the one mentioned above would be to adjust the manner in which the student gains
support. The student should be assisted in a manner that does not give the student the solution but rather helps them grow their problem-solving skills by
providing them with steps to take when problem-solving. This method would force the student to find the problem on their own whilst still getting support to
facilitate this process. The student should be taught how to break down the assessments into more manageable steps that they are able to solve as this is vital
and will help the student progress further.

- Technological issues
Some students may have major technological issues such as a lack of stable internet connection. This may result to the student being unable to complete their
assessments and in some cases even dropping out.

A solution to prevent a student from dropping out in a circumstance such as the one mentioned above would be to provide the student with downloadable
resources and references to learning material that may assist them even throughout any technological issues they may encounter. The student should also be referred
to the support team to discuss their situation and any mutually beneficial steps that may be taken in regard to the students course, course length...etc
